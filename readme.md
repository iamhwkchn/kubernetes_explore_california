# Explore California Website Containerization and Kubernetes Deployment

This project focuses on containerizing the Explore California static website hosted on virtual machines in AWS and deploying it using Kubernetes. By leveraging the power of containers, Kubernetes orchestration, and cloud-native technologies, the project aims to enhance scalability, reliability, and ease of management for Explore California.

## Project Highlights

- Containerized the Explore California static website, leveraging the efficiency and portability of containers for deployment and management.
- Utilized Kubernetes to migrate the website into containers, benefiting from its robust container orchestration capabilities.
- Automated the website startup process using Docker and Make, streamlining the deployment and ensuring ease of management.
- Created a comprehensive "Helm chart" to facilitate the deployment of Explore California onto a local Kubernetes cluster provisioned with Kind, a Docker-based instance of Kubernetes.
- Configured and deployed Explore California into AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), harnessing the benefits of a managed Kubernetes offering for scalable and reliable production deployment.
- Leveraged AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) as a secure and private alternative to Docker Hub, ensuring efficient management and storage of container images for Explore California.
- Demonstrated proficiency in managing the end-to-end deployment pipeline, from containerization to Kubernetes orchestration, ensuring seamless and reliable delivery of the Explore California website.
- Gained practical experience in working with cloud-native technologies, including Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, and AWS services, showcasing proficiency in modern application deployment practices.
- Showcased problem-solving skills and adaptability to new technologies, successfully completing the migration of a complex static website into a containerized architecture with Kubernetes.
- Collaborated with a team to ensure smooth integration of containerization and Kubernetes deployment processes, demonstrating effective communication and teamwork abilities.
